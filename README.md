# chip8Emulator
Custom CHIP-8 interpreter

This was my first attempt at writting an emulator

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

Writting an emulator for the CHIP-8 is an easy project to get started in emulator development due to the simplicity of the CHIP-8.
